# Thranduil

A UI module for LÖVE. Facilitates the creation of game specific UI through UI elements that have all 
their logic abstracted away (anything having to do with input, if this element has been pressed, is focused, etc), 
leaving the user (you) with the job of specifying only how those elements will be drawn. test

## Usage

The [module]() should be dropped on your project and required like so:

```lua
UI = require 'UI'
```

After that, register the UI module to most of LÖVE's callbacks, like this:

```lua
function love.update(dt)
  -- add your stuff here!!!
  -- UI's update call must come after everything
  UI.update(dt)
end

function love.keypressed(key)
  UI.keypressed(key)
end

function love.keyreleased(key)
  UI.keyreleased(key)
end

function love.mousepressed(x, y, button)
  UI.mousepressed(button)
end

function love.mousereleased(x, y, button)
  UI.mousereleased(button)
end

function love.gamepadpressed(joystick, button)
  UI.gamepadpressed(joystick, button)
end

function love.gamepadreleased(joystick, button)
  UI.gamepadreleased(joystick, button)
end

function love.gamepadaxis(joystick, axis, value)
  UI.gamepadaxis(joystick, axis, value)
end

function love.textinput(text)
  UI.textinput(text)
end
```

## Introduction

For this example we'll create a button object at position (10, 10) with width/height (90, 90):

```lua
button = UI.Button(10, 10, 90, 90)
```

This object can then be updated via `button:update(dt)` and it will automatically have its attributes changed as the user hovers, selects or presses it. Calling `button:draw()` won't do anything because by default all UI elements don't have a draw function defined. To do that:

```lua
button.draw = function(self)
  love.graphics.setColor(64, 64, 64)
  love.graphics.rectangle('fill', self.x, self.y, self.w, self.h)
  if self.down then
    love.graphics.setColor(32, 32, 32)
    love.graphics.rectangle('fill', self.x, self.y, self.w, self.h)
  end
  love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
end
```

Define the button's draw function and use its attributes to change how the button looks. All UI elements created with this module need to have their draw functions specified explicitly because this module's job only deals with handling an UI element's logic. For user convenience a few [themes](#themes) were created to test things out though.
